## Customizing the Mod

### Adding New Items

1. Create a new model in Blockbench and export as GeckoLib format
2. Place the model file in `src/main/resources/assets/ancientcurse/models/entity/`
3. Place the animation file in `src/main/resources/assets/ancientcurse/animations/`
4. Place the texture in `src/main/resources/assets/ancientcurse/textures/item/`
5. Create a standard item model JSON in `src/main/resources/assets/ancientcurse/models/item/`
6. Register your new item in the `ModItems` class

### Animation Tips

- All animations are defined in the `.animation.json` file
- Reference animations in your code by their exact name (e.g., `animation.model.sun`)
- You can switch animations based on different events (right-click, equip, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

If animations don't work:
1. Check the Minecraft log for errors
2. Verify file paths in your model class
3. Ensure animation names match exactly
4. Make sure your textures are in the correct location
