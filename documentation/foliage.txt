1. Cursed Tombs & Traps
Pharaohs' tombs were intricately designed with deadly traps to prevent tomb raiders.
Mod Idea: Implement hidden chambers, booby traps (falling sand blocks, poison darts), or curse triggers (mobs spawning when chests are opened).

A scroll containing spells guiding the deceased safely to the afterlife.
Mod Idea: Players can collect scroll fragments to craft spells that grant temporary buffs or protect against curses.

Egyptians believed mummification preserved the body for the afterlife.
Mod Idea: Introduce mummified mobs (like mummy villagers or pharaoh bosses) with unique animations and abilities (slowing the player or causing blindness).

Animals like cats, crocodiles, jackals, and falcons symbolized protection or punishment.
Mod Idea: Animal-themed mobs (like guardian jackals or spectral crocodiles) guarding treasures or cursed locations.

Egyptians believed hieroglyphs were powerful magical symbols.
Mod Idea: Hieroglyph blocks that activate mechanisms or puzzles when correctly arranged, or grant players special enchantments.

7. Amulets & Talismans
Egyptians wore protective amulets for luck, strength, or protection from evil spirits.
Mod Idea: Players can craft amulets granting special resistances (anti-curse amulet, protection from undead).
8. Judgment in the Afterlife
Souls were judged against the feather of Ma'at (truth) to determine afterlife fate.
Mod Idea: A boss battle involving an entity representing judgment, weighing player actions (karma system) that affects outcomes.
9. Solar & Lunar Mythology
Ra (Sun God) sailed across the sky, battling the serpent Apophis each night.
Mod Idea: Day-night mechanics where curses become stronger or mobs spawn aggressively at night, requiring protective artifacts.
10. The Curse of Tutankhamun
Real-life historical belief that disturbing King Tutâ€™s tomb unleashed misfortune.
Mod Idea: A powerful Pharaoh's tomb that, once opened, initiates challenging events or curses players must break by performing rituals or tasks.
11. Sacred Architecture
Temples like Karnak and Luxor were built precisely aligned with astronomical events.
Mod Idea: Structures that activate during specific moon phases or alignments, revealing hidden treasures or triggering special events.

Miniature statues placed in tombs believed to serve the dead in the afterlife.
Mod Idea: Collectible Shabti statues that can summon temporary servants or allies, aiding players against enemies.
