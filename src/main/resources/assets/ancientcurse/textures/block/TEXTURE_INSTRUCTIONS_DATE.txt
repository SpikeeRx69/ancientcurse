Please add the following texture files to this directory:

1. date_block_stage0.png - Texture for the small, young date fruit (stage 0)
2. date_block_stage1.png - Texture for the medium, growing date fruit (stage 1)
3. date_block_stage2.png - Texture for the fully grown date fruit (stage 2)

These textures will be used for the Date Block that attaches to Date Palm Logs, similar to how cocoa beans work in vanilla Minecraft.

The textures should follow a similar style to cocoa beans but with a more date-like appearance:
- Stage 0: Small green/yellowish pod
- Stage 1: Medium-sized yellow/orange cluster
- Stage 2: Fully grown brown/reddish date cluster

The Date Block will drop Sekhem Dates when harvested at full growth.
