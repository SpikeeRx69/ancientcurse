1. sekhem_date.png - Texture for the Sekhem Date food item

This texture will be used for the Sekhem Date food item that players can harvest from the Date Block when it's fully grown.

The Sekhem Date should look like a dried date fruit with a rich brown/reddish color, typical of dates that were a staple food in ancient Egypt.

In-game, the Sekhem Date provides 5 hunger points and gives the player Fire Resistance for 10 seconds, making it a valuable food item for desert exploration.
